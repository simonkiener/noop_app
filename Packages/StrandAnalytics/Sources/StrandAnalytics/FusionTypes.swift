// MARK: - Fusion value types (v5 — Local Multi-Device Fusion)
//
// The plain inputs/outputs for the pure fusion engine described in
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-local-multi-device-fusion-design.md. No I/O, no model, no
// network — the Repository feeds these rows it already loads, the engine returns a resolved point.
// These deliberately mirror the existing `DailyMetricSource` / `SourcedDailyMetric` provenance
// vocabulary (Repository.swift L61-82) but generalised to cover every importer source so a future
// Polar/Garmin/Oura is a table entry, not a type change. Value-for-value Kotlin twin in
// android/.../analytics/FusionTypes.kt.

/// Where a fused number came from — a superset of the legacy `DailyMetricSource` (whoopImport /
/// noopComputed / appleHealth / localCache), extended to every source the importers already write.
/// The rawValue is the canonical source id (`Repository.whoopSource` etc.) so a `FusionSource` round-
/// trips to/from the stored `deviceId` / source string without a lookup table.
